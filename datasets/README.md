**Note** : Only FEMNIST dataset has been implemented till now.

To download the FEMNIST dataset follow the following steps:

'''bash
chmod +x download.sh
'''

'''bash
bash download.sh -f
'''
The above command will save the data inside data folder (which is meant to be a dictionary of all datasets).
