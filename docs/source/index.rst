EnvisEdge allows users to simulate an edge computing environment to test their ideas and models before putting them in place on the edge. It takes care of all the complex stuff such as diversity across operating systems, computation power and communication mediums, allowing you to focus on the idea rather than the setup. 

EnvisEdge allows researchers, developers and data scientists to experiment and test their hypotheses, and produce production-ready code without having direct access to the edge devices. Creating a path for global research and growth in the domains of federated learning and edge computing.


**Key feature of EnvisEdge**

1. Provides a platform for global or remote teams to run and test their systems/models prior to deployment.
2. Run, train and test FL algorithms and ML models. 
3. Can setup environment of your choice with any arbitrary hardware constraints such as RAM, CPU and more. 
4. Experience Edge on cloud and your devices.
