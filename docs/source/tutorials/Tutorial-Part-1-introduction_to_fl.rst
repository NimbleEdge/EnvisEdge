Introduction to Federated Learning
==================================

What is Federated Learning?
---------------------------

Before we dive into how you can deploy an FL system lets go through the
lifecycle of federated learning and set the standard definitions.
`Kairouz et. al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf>`__ is a
fantastic survey of the current literature on Federated Learning. We
quote them to define Federated Learning

   **Federated learning**\ * is a machine learning setting where multiple
   entities (*\ `clients <#clients>`__\ *) collaborate in solving a
   machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server
   or service provider. Each clientâ€™s raw data is stored locally and not
   exchanged or transferred; instead ,focused updates intended for
   immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective.*


Types of Federated learning
---------------------------

Federated Learning is broadly classified as 

* **Model Centric:**
  
  When the distributed data is used to improve a central model with
  a goal of delivering better centrally administered models, it is known
  as Model-Centric Federated Learning.


  Model Centric Federated Learning is further classifid into:
  
  * **Cross-Device Federated Learning**
    
    When Federated Learning takes place through suitable federated techniques
    from data across a wide range of devices.

    Typically, Cross-Device FL uses Horizontal Federated Learning
    

    * So when data sets share the same features but are different in samples.
    * This is also called as Homogeneous Federated Learning.
    * Supervised Learning uses Horizontal datasets.
  
  * **Cross-Silo Federated Learning**

    Similar to Cross-Device FL, this FL aims to create a more centrally sound model.

    But, instead of small concentration of data, here humongous amounts of data are
    stored in clusters like Hadoop/Spark.

    Here data sets are partitioned Vertically. Lets take a look at Vertical-FL.

    * When the data set has similar samples, but has different feature sets, it is known
      as Vertical-FL.
   
* **Data-Centric FL:**

  * Data Centric Federated Learning is where private users can give organisations
    access to build models on their data without sharing it.

  * This concept can be further expaned to a Cloud of Cross-Silo FL, where similar
    strategy could be implemented.

Clients
~~~~~~~

Clients are the devices responsible for training the model on a dataset
hold locally.

Aggregators
~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregators are resposible for taking model updates from several clients
and generating an averaged model from the submissions. The same device
can behave as both a client and aggregator as it happens in
decentralized FL.

Neighbours
~~~~~~~~~~

Neighbours in the context of FL are workers (clients/aggregators) which
can send and recieve model updates from each other. In the standard
centralized FL setting, every client has only the central server as its
neighbour.

Federated Learning Cycle
------------------------

An horizontal FL cycle consists of 5 steps:

Client selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we start training our global model, we need to select the
participants. Every aggregator samples a subset or all of its neighbours
and asks for model updates from it. In some cases the neighbours first
apply for participation and then the aggregator decides who amongst them
should be accepted.

Model download
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the model parameters and execution plans, if not done already.
Once accepted into the cycle, the workers ask for necessary information
to begin training.

Local training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each worker runs a specific number of iterations locally with the data
that is available on the device. It updates its local model weights and
uses them for inference

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~

Once all the participants have finished the training process, they
submit their model updates to the aggregator which began the cycle. The
aggregator keeps on waiting until a fraction of accepted devices report
back with their models.

The workers often only send the compressed model weights to reduce the
data consumption

Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregator then averages the model weights to generate the final
global model. It often uses non-linear combination of these models to
account for their history and error in communication.

Federated Learning in Deployment
--------------------------------

Now lets explore the roles and steps needed to productionize the fl
deployment. What will an engineer need to do to deploy these solutions?

Device instrumentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Store relevant data with an expiry date that is necessary for training.
Preprocessing data for future use. Storing user-item interaction matrix
for recommendations, etc

Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~

Prototype model architectures and FL strategies on a dummy data on cloud
to set the expectations of the architecture.

Federated model training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run training procedures for different types of models with different
hyper parameters. At the end we choose the best ones for aggregation.

Federated model evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metrics are extracted out on the held out data on cloud and the data
distributed on the devices to find the performance.

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

Manual quality assurance, live A/B testing and staged rollout. Usually
the engineer determines this process. It is exactly similar to how a
normally trained model will be deployed.

We will first build a `normal ML
pipeline <./Tutorial-Part-2-starting_with_nimbleedge.rst>`__ and then
convert it into Federated Setting.
