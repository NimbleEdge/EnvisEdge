Data Processors and Data Loaders
================================

This tutorial is consists of four parts:

1. Data Interfaces
2. Data Loaders
3. Data Samplers
4. Walkthrough using an example

Data Interfaces
---------------


Data Loaders
------------

In this section we will discuss how to use the data loaders to load and
iterate through a dataset.

#. Dataloader
#. Dataloader-iterators


DataLoader
------------

This is the base class that defines the implementation of all DataLoaders.
It’s an integral part of handling the entire Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipeline process of a dataset. It is an Iteratable object(dataset)

    * reset(): this resets its content every time it is called.

.. code:: kotlin

        interface DataLoader : Iterable<List<IValue>> {

            fun reset() {}

        }



Dataloader-iterator
-------------------

It’s used to load that dataset in samples and chunks.

    * dataLoader: this input is used to define the loading and sampling process of a particular dataset
    * next(): this uses uses a specified index range to fetch and load data in chunks
    * hasNext(): this checks if the current index exists in the index range of the dataset.


.. code:: kotlin

        class DataLoaderIterator(private val dataLoader: SyftDataLoader) : Iterator<List<IValue>> {

            private val indexSampler = dataLoader.indexSampler

            private var currentIndex = 0

            override fun next(): List<IValue> {
                val indices = indexSampler.indices
                currentIndex += indices.size
                return dataLoader.fetch(indices)
            }

            override fun hasNext(): Boolean = currentIndex < dataLoader.dataset.length

            fun reset() {
                currentIndex = 0
            }

        }



Data Samplers
-------------

In this section we will discuss how to use the data samplers to create a
dataset of a fixed size. We will walk through the following various types of data samplers like:

#. Sampler
#. Batch Sampler
#. Random Sampler
#. Sequential Sampler

Sampler
~~~~~~~~

It’s the base for all Samplers. Whenever we create a sampler or a subclass of sampler, we need to provide two methods named Indices and length

    * Indices: it provides a way to iterate over indices of dataset elements.
    * Length: It returns the length of the returned iterators.

.. code:: kotlin

        interface Sampler {

            val indices: List<Int>
            val length: Int
        }


Batch Samplers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests Batch, It process the samplers in a batch or group. It wraps another sampler to yield a mini-batch of indices. It has three properties:

    * indexer- It’s a base sampler which can be any iterable object.
    * batchSize - The Size of mini-batch
    * dropLast - If its value is True and the size would less than batchSize then the sampler will drop the last batch.

.. code:: kotlin

        class BatchSampler(
            private val indexer: Sampler,
            private val batchSize: Int = 1,
            private val dropLast: Boolean = false
        ) : Sampler {

            private val mIndices = indexer.indices

            private var currentIndex = 0

            override val indices: List<Int>
                get() = when {
                    currentIndex + batchSize < mIndices.size -> {
                        val batch = mIndices.slice(currentIndex until currentIndex + batchSize)
                        currentIndex += batch.size
                        batch
                    }
                    else -> {
                        if (dropLast) {
                            emptyList()
                        } else {
                            val batch = mIndices.drop(currentIndex)
                            currentIndex = mIndices.size
                            batch
                        }
                    }
                }

            override val length: Int = if (dropLast) floor(1.0 * indexer.length / batchSize).toInt()
                else ceil(1.0 * indexer.length / batchSize).toInt()

            fun reset() {
                currentIndex = 0
            }
        }


Random Samplers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, It samples the elements randomly. It has two main components. A user can opt for with or without the replacements.

    * Without replacements: It samples from a shuffled dataset.
    * With replacements: It gives the user a bit more control on what portion you need to select. The user can specify the num_samples to draw from the dataset.
    * dataset: It’s a property of the class.

.. code:: kotlin

    class RandomSampler(private val dataset: Dataset) :
        Sampler {

        override val indices = List(dataset.length) { it }.shuffled()

        override val length: Int = dataset.length

    }

Sequential Samplers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, it samples the elements sequentially and always in the same order. It also has a property named dataset:

    * dataset: It’s the source from where we can sample the elements.

.. code:: kotlin

        class SequentialSampler(private val dataset: Dataset) :
            Sampler {

            override val indices = List(dataset.length) { it }

            override val length: Int = dataset.length

        }
